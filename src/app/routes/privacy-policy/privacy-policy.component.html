        <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use of C</strong>o<strong>okies</strong></h3>
        <p>A cookie is a small data file which is sent from a web server to a web browser when that browser visits the server’s site. Find out more about the use of cookies on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Cookies are used, on the jober24.ch website to remember your login, to track web traffic on an aggregate basis so that no individuals are identified, to keep session information such as your last search (this information is disposed of every time you close your web browser). Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of our website.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy Policy for Cookies</h3>
        <p>This site uses cookies. Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user’s computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after their visit to an online offering. The information stored can include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the location where a video was watched. The term “cookies” also includes other technologies that fulfill the same functions as cookies (e.g. when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as “user IDs”).</p>
        <p>The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies)<br></strong>Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed their browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Persistent cookies<br></strong>Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The interests of users, which are used to measure reach or for marketing purposes, can also be stored in such a cookie.</li>
          <li><strong>First-party cookies<br></strong>First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-party cookies (also: third-party cookies)<br></strong>Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.</li>
          <li><strong>Necessary (also: essential or strictly necessary) cookies<br></strong>On the one hand, cookies can be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to save logins or other user input or for security reasons).</li>
          <li><strong>Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies<br></strong>Cookies are also generally used to measure reach and when a user’s interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) are stored in a user profile on individual websites. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that corresponds to their potential interests. This process is also known as “tracking”, i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our data protection declaration or when obtaining consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notes on legal basis:</strong>&nbsp;The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you agree to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offering and its improvement) or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage period:</strong>&nbsp;Unless we provide you with explicit information about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. as part of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.</p>
        <p>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out): Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke your consent or to object to the processing of your data using cookie technologies ( collectively referred to as “opt-out”). You can first declare your objection using your browser settings, for example by deactivating the use of cookies (which may also limit the functionality of our online offering). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared using a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/ become. You can also receive further objection information as part of the information about the service providers and cookies used.</p>
        <p>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: We use a cookie consent management process, in which users consent to the use of cookies or the processing mentioned within the cookie consent management process and providers can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. The declaration of consent is saved so that it does not have to be asked again and to be able to prove consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or using comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information about the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. Here, a pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of consent, information about the scope of the consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and device used.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong>&nbsp;Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
          <li><strong>Data subjects:</strong>&nbsp;Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
          <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong>&nbsp;Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Privacy policy&nbsp;</strong>for SSL/TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as the requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the browser’s address line changing from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
        <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy Policy for Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited. If the person responsible for data processing on this website is located outside the European Economic Area or Switzerland, then Google Analytics data processing is carried out by Google LLC. Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited are hereinafter referred to as “Google”.</p>
        <p>We can use the statistics obtained to improve our offering and make it more interesting for you as a user. This website also uses Google Analytics for a cross-device analysis of visitor flows, which is carried out via a user ID. If you have a Google user account, you can deactivate the cross-device analysis of your usage in the settings there under “My data”, “Personal data”.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 Letter f of the GDPR. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other Google data. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics is supplemented by the code “_anonymizeIp();” has been expanded to ensure anonymized collection of IP addresses. This means that IP addresses are further processed in abbreviated form, which means that any personal connection can be ruled out. If the data collected about you is personally related, this will be excluded immediately and the personal data will be deleted immediately.</p>
        <p>Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; However, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading the browser plug-in available under the following link and install: deactivate Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>You can also prevent the use of Google Analytics by clicking on this link: Deactivate Google Analytics. This means that a so-called opt-out cookie is stored on your data carrier, which prevents the processing of personal data by Google Analytics. Please note that if you delete all cookies on your device, these opt-out cookies will also be deleted, i.e. you will have to set the opt-out cookies again if you still want to prevent this form of data collection. The opt-out cookies are set per browser and computer/device and must therefore be activated separately for each browser, computer or other device.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Data protection declaration for the use of Google Web Fonts</h3>
        <p>This website uses so-called web fonts, which are provided by Google, for the uniform display of fonts. When you access a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly. If your browser does not support web fonts, your computer will use a standard font.</p>
        <p>Further information about Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google’s privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Google Tag Manager</h3>
        <p>Google Tag Manager is a solution with which we can manage so-called website tags via an interface and, for example, integrate Google Analytics and other Google marketing services into our online offering. The tag manager itself, which implements the tags, does not process any of the users’ personal data. With regard to the processing of users’ personal data, reference is made to the following information on Google services. Usage guidelines:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html">https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Audio and video conferences</h3>
        <p>We use audio and video conferencing services to communicate with our users and others. In particular, we can use it to hold audio and video conferences, virtual meetings and training courses such as webinars.</p>
        <p>We only use services that ensure adequate data protection. In addition to this data protection declaration, any conditions of the services used, such as terms of use or data protection declarations, also apply.</p>
        <p>In particular, we use Zoom, a service from the American Zoom Video Communications Inc. Zoom also grants the rights under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to users in Switzerland. Further information about the type, scope and purpose of data processing can be found in Zoom’s&nbsp;<a href="https://zoom.us/de-de/privacy.html">data protection guidelines</a>&nbsp;and on the “<a href="https://zoom.us/docs/de-de/privacy-and-legal.html">Legal provisions and data protection</a>” page.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legal basis for processing</h3>
        <p>Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of any other service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, such as to fulfill tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance details or other vital information would then have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the above-mentioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. We are permitted to carry out such processing operations in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he was of the opinion that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legitimate interests in processing pursued by the controller or a third party</h3>
        <p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest is to carry out our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Duration for which the personal data will be stored</h3>
        <p>The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the deadline has expired, the relevant data will be routinely deleted unless it is no longer required to fulfill the contract or initiate a contract.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h3>
        <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the recruitment process.</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
          <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
          <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
          <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
          <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
          <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us at admin&#64;jober24.ch</p>
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Complaints</h3>
        <p>If you have any concerns or complaints about data protection you should first raise this with us either by email to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:admin@jober24.ch">admin&#64;jober24.ch</a>&nbsp;or by post: Jober24 Group GmbH, Neuhofstrasse 12, 6340 Baar.</p>
        <p>If you have a complaint or concern that has not been remedied internally, you may choose to raise this with the Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO). Visit www.ico.org for more information.</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Any changes we may make to our Policy in the future will be posted on this page.</p>
